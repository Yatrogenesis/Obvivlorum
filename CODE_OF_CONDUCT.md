### Reporting Guidelines

* Use institutional reporting channels if you are affiliated with an academic institution

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or academic misconduct.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

### Research-Specific Enforcement

For research-related violations:

* **Academic Misconduct**: May result in removal from co-authorship, retraction
  requests, and notification to relevant academic institutions
* **Data Falsification**: Immediate permanent ban and notification to relevant
  authorities
* **Ethical Violations**: Review by an ethics panel and potential permanent ban

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been unfairly sanctioned, you may appeal by:

1. **Contacting the enforcement team** within 30 days of the decision
2. **Providing new evidence** or clarification of the situation
3. **Requesting mediation** from a neutral third party if available
4. **Escalating to institutional channels** if you are affiliated with an academic institution

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders not involved in the original decision.
