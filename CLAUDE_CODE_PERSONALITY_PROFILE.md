## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CODING RULE: NO EMOJIS IN CODE

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: NEVER use emojis or Unicode characters in ANY code files.

### Why This Rule Exists:
- **Windows cp1252 encoding failures** cause application crashes
- **"Blinking" behavior**: Apps start then immediately close due to Unicode errors
- **4,930 Unicode characters** were found contaminating the entire codebase
- **Systematic cleanup required** to achieve system stability

### Where Emojis ARE Allowed:
- **Markdown documentation** files (*.md) for visual appeal
- **Comments in Markdown** for descriptive purposes only
- **README files** for user-friendly presentation

### Where Emojis Are FORBIDDEN:
- **Python files** (*.py) - ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION
- **JavaScript files** (*.js) - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **Any executable code** - ZERO TOLERANCE
- **Configuration files** - COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN
- **Batch files** (*.bat) - NO UNICODE ALLOWED

### Enforcement:
- **Line-by-line verification** of all code files
- **Automatic cleanup scripts** for Unicode contamination
- **Testing on Windows cp1252** to verify compatibility
- **GitHub updates** only after Unicode cleanup completion
